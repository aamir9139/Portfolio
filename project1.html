    <p class="c2 r2">Flare is an emergency smartphone application for people who find themselves abroad in countries that are in a state of conflict. It is meant to be used by people such as humanitarian workers and journalists, allowing them to have a system that is able to monitor their safety and relay their last known location to their embassy in case of an emergency. In addition to this, the phone is able to store any vital medical information that the user would need to let doctors or paramedic know in case they become unconscious.</p>

       <p class="c-span-1 r2 intro-text">I am a third-year design student from SFUâ€™s School of Interactive Art and Technology with a B.A. in Psychology from UBC. As a user-experience (UX) designer, this combination of design and psychology has allowed for a process that is very data-driven, analytical and user-centered. Additionally, it provides me with a unique sociological lens through which I am able to contextualize my work. In my career, I seek to create innovative digital solutions for often overlooked problems, in the hopes that I can make an impact on the lives of people. My current skillset includes technical knowledge in Adobe Suite, Sketch, Principle, Figma, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This, in addition to my experience in roles such as project management, interaction design, UI design, content strategy, product strategy and UX research, have allowed to become an adaptable designer that is able to incorporate the needs of all stakeholders into the work that I do. </p>
